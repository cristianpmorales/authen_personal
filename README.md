## Project

The start to my final project, an authentication page for an admin. 

## Optimizations

Future improvements would be calling information from a database instead of entering. As well as placing this information to a table instead of spans. 

## Lessons Learned

Getting more confident creating a database and finding a solution to simple errors. As well as learning to create a better user expirience.
